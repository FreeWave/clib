Building
--------

You can build all of libavl or just one part.  Here are the commands
to build a few interesting subsets:

	* Everything: `make'.

Installing
----------

clib is not intended to be installed as a shared library.  Instead,
its source files are meant to be included in programs directly.	 A
given program normally uses only one or two of libavl's tree
structures.  Only the C source and header files for those structures
need to be included.  Refer to the libavl manual for more information.

As a result, there is no real "installation procedure" for clib.  If
you like, you can install the test and demo programs in a convenient
location, but it hard to imagine a practical use for them other than
as tests and demonstrations.
